# Product Requirements Document: KubeRocketAI Showcase Website

## 1. Problem/Opportunity

Developers and AI adopters lack a fast, visual way to understand KubeRocketAI’s value without reading through code-heavy GitHub docs. This creates unnecessary friction in discovery, evaluation, and internal stakeholder buy-in, slowing adoption and community growth.

**Evidence:**

- GitHub repo shows limited discoverability and stars relative to potential audience
- No dedicated landing/education experience for non-maintainers
- User research indicates developers prefer interactive demos and concise overviews prior to deep technical evaluation
- Alignment with the approved Project Brief goals and constraints

## 2. Target Users & Use Cases

**Primary Users:**

- Developers, DevOps engineers, and AI practitioners evaluating agent frameworks
- Senior developers/tech leads exploring the framework for team adoption

**Key Use Cases:**

1. Quickly grasp the framework’s value proposition and core capabilities in under 5 minutes
2. Experience agent personas and interactive demos to understand real usage patterns
3. Skim SDLC fit (Brief → PRD → Epics → Stories) and architecture at a glance
4. Navigate to the GitHub repository for implementation details and examples
5. Share a credible landing link with teammates and decision-makers
6. Provide lightweight feedback or use cases without backend services

---

## 3. Current Journeys/Landscape (Optional)

**Current User Journey:**

- Developers discover the repository via search or social links, then parse README and code. This is time-consuming, lacks visual clarity, and does not demonstrate personas or interactive value.

**Competitive Landscape:**

- Similar OSS AI tools often lack a cohesive showcase site or central demo experience. Commercial platforms feature strong landing pages and demos; this project balances clarity and zero-cost hosting.

## 4. Proposed Solution/Elevator Pitch

**Elevator Pitch:**

Create a zero-cost, static showcase website that visually communicates KubeRocketAI’s value, demonstrates agent personas via interactive client-side demos, and guides developers to documentation and the GitHub repository—all optimized for fast evaluation and shareability.

**Top 3 MVP Value Props:**

1. Clear, credible value communication in minutes (not hours)
2. Linked or embedded YouTube demos make capabilities tangible without setup
3. Seamless path to GitHub and docs to proceed with adoption

**Conceptual Model:**

Visitor lands on hero → scans value props → explores 1–2 interactive persona demos → reviews SDLC mapping and feature highlights → follows primary CTAs to GitHub/docs → optionally leaves feedback.

## 5. Goals/Measurable Outcomes

**Success Metrics (aligned with Project Brief):**

1. Traffic and conversion
   - 100+ unique visitors in month 1; 300+ by month 3
   - ≥15% click-through rate to GitHub by month 3
2. Engagement and content consumption
   - ≥3 minutes average session duration by month 2
   - ≥60% of visitors interact with persona demos
   - ≥40% click-through to architecture/documentation links
3. GitHub and community impact
   - ≥25 new GitHub stars within 3 months of launch
   - ≥10 feedback submissions/use cases within 2 months
   - ≥3 teams report website-initiated framework evaluation

## 6. MVP/Functional Requirements

Focus on functional outcomes for users; avoid technical implementation specifics.

### Business Requirements (BR)

**BR1 [P0]:** Landing page communicates the value proposition with a clear headline, subtext, and primary CTAs ("Explore Demos", "View on GitHub").

**BR2 [P0]:** Provide at least two demos: embedded YouTube videos and/or interactive, client-side persona demos showcasing how agents behave or collaborate (no backend required).

**BR3 [P0]:** Explain SDLC integration (Project Brief → PRD → Epics → Stories) with a simple visual/diagram and link to docs.

**BR4 [P0]:** Present a feature showcase that highlights practical capabilities (e.g., token awareness, validation, IDE integration) with concise copy and visual tiles.

**BR5 [P1]:** Include a short embedded video or animated walkthrough demonstrating the framework or persona flows.

**BR6 [P1]:** Provide a low-friction feedback path (e.g., link to GitHub Discussions/Issues or mailto) without server-side processing.

**BR7 [P1]:** Include privacy-friendly, lightweight analytics (or stub) to gauge traffic, engagement, and CTA performance.

**BR8 [P2]:** Add a simple roadmap or "What’s next" section aligned to epics to set expectations.

**BR9 [P2]:** Provide a dark mode toggle to improve readability and modern UX appeal.

**BR10 [P2]:** Basic SEO metadata and social share (Open Graph/Twitter) previews for the home page.

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

**NFR1 [P0]:** Performance suitable for mobile and desktop; initial page load under 3 seconds on standard broadband.

**NFR2 [P0]:** Zero hosting cost using free tiers (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel) with public repository.

**NFR3 [P0]:** Accessibility: meet core WCAG 2.1 AA basics (color contrast, landmarks, keyboard navigation).

**NFR4 [P1]:** Cross-browser compatibility for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

**NFR5 [P1]:** Lighthouse targets: ≥90 Performance and ≥90 Accessibility on the landing page.

**NFR6 [P1]:** Uptime consistent with selected free hosting’s SLA; page remains available to global audiences.

**NFR7 [P2]:** Localization readiness (copy centralized, avoid baked-in images of text).

**NFR8 [P2]:** Privacy: analytics must be opt-out friendly and avoid collecting PII.

### MVP Epic and Workstreams (2-week delivery)

Consolidate scope into a single MVP epic to fit a 2-week timeline for one developer, leveraging AI-assisted content generation.

#### MVP Epic: Launch Showcase Website (2 weeks)

Workstreams (each maps to BR/NFR for traceability):

- WS1: Awareness & Landing
  - BR1, BR4, BR10; NFR1, NFR5
- WS2: Demos (YouTube embeds and/or client-side)
  - BR2, BR5; NFR1, NFR4
- WS3: Documentation Navigation
  - BR3, BR4; NFR4, NFR5
- WS4: Feedback & Insights
  - BR6, BR7, BR8; NFR8

Delivery plan

- Week 1
  - Day 1–2: WS1 skeleton (hero, value props, CTAs), base styling, SEO/meta boilerplate
  - Day 3–4: WS2 demo stubs + YouTube placeholder embeds; WS3 docs navigation section
  - Day 5: Content polish, accessibility pass, performance baseline
- Week 2
  - Day 6–7: WS4 feedback links (Discussions/Issues/mailto), lightweight analytics stub
  - Day 8: Visual refinements, dark mode (if time), lighthouse tuning
  - Day 9: Cross-browser QA, mobile perf verification, copy edits
  - Day 10: Finalize, publish to free hosting (Pages/Netlify/Vercel), smoke test

De-scoping levers (if timeline risk)

- Drop P2 items first: BR8 (roadmap), BR9 (dark mode)
- Keep demos as YouTube embeds if interactive client-side demos slip
- Analytics can remain a stub; add real metrics post-MVP
- Video/animation (BR5) is optional if copy + screenshots suffice

AI acceleration (recommended)

- Use an AI page generator or design assistant to draft hero copy, feature tiles, and typography system
- Generate image assets and illustrations via prompts; compress for web
- Use AI to produce initial demo scripts and narration for YouTube videos

---

### Scope and Constraints Alignment

- Static site only; no backend services or databases
- Free-tier hosting required; keep dependencies lean and footprint small
- Content must align with existing KubeRocketAI docs and remain easy to update via markdown/static files
- Simple CSS/JS animations acceptable; avoid heavy frameworks unless justified by performance budgets

---

### Out of Scope (MVP)

- Authenticated user accounts or complex content management
- Backend data storage or dynamic server-rendered pages
- Deep technical API documentation (lives in GitHub repository)
