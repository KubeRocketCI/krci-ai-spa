    IMPORTANT!!!: Interactive Task Loop with User Feedback. ALWAYS RUN 'python3 userinput.py'
    1. **Check if `userinput.py` exists** in the root directory.
      * If it doesn't exist, create it with the following content:
        ```python
        # userinput.py
        user_input = input("prompt: ")
        ```
    2. **Main Workflow**:
      * Perform your assigned tasks.
      * Run:
        ```bash
        python3 userinput.py
        ```
      * The terminal should be opened in the chat window itself.
      * Read the user's input.
      * Based on the input, perform the next set of tasks.
      * Repeat the process.
    3. **Exit Condition**:
      * If the user enters `"stop"` when prompted, exit the loop and terminate the process.
