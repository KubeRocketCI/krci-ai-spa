# KubeRocketAI Showcase Website

A static showcase website for the [KubeRocketAI framework](https://github.com/KubeRocketCI/kuberocketai), built using KubeRocketAI's own AI-as-code SDLC methodology. This repository demonstrates how to go from idea to production-ready code with clear artifacts, quality gates, and structured delivery.

## 🎥 Watch the Build Process

This project is featured in our YouTube series demonstrating the complete KubeRocketAI SDLC workflow:

**[Episode 1: Idea → Brief → PRD → Epic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6R4v_tpIhE)**

Learn how we transformed an idea into structured project artifacts using AI agents for:

- Project Brief creation and validation
- Product Requirements Document (PRD) drafting
- MVP Epic definition with clear scope and acceptance criteria

*Future episodes will cover Stories, implementation, and deployment.*

## 🚀 Project Overview

### Purpose

Create a zero-cost static website that helps developers quickly understand and evaluate KubeRocketAI's value proposition, reducing evaluation time from hours to minutes through interactive demos and clear documentation navigation.

### Key Features

- **Fast Evaluation Journey**: Value comprehension in under 5 minutes
- **Interactive Demos**: Agent persona demonstrations and YouTube embeds
- **SDLC Integration**: Visual mapping of Brief → PRD → Epics → Stories
- **Zero-Cost Hosting**: Optimized for GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel free tiers
- **Performance Focused**: Lighthouse scores ≥90 for Performance and Accessibility

## 🛠 SDLC Methodology

This project showcases the complete [KubeRocketAI SDLC workflow](https://github.com/KubeRocketCI/kuberocketai/blob/main/docs/architecture/13-sdlc-framework.md):

1. **Idea** → Identified need for accessible framework showcase
2. **Project Brief** → Defined problem, opportunity, and constraints
3. **PRD** → Detailed requirements, success metrics, and scope
4. **Epic Draft** → MVP definition with user stories and acceptance criteria
5. **Epic Refinement** → Finalized epic with detailed user stories and tasks → *(Coming in Episode 2)*
6. **Stories** → *(Coming in Episode 2)*
7. **Implementation** → *(Coming in Episode 3)*
8. **QA & Release** → *(Coming in Episode 4)*

## 📋 Key Documents

### [Project Brief](docs/prd/project-brief.md)

Executive summary covering problem statement, target users, success metrics, and constraints. Establishes the business case for a developer-focused showcase website.

### [Product Requirements Document](docs/prd/prd.md)

Comprehensive requirements including:

- Business Requirements (BR1-BR10)
- Non-Functional Requirements (NFR1-NFR8)
- MVP Epic scope and delivery timeline
- Success metrics and acceptance criteria

### [Epic 01: Launch Showcase Website](docs/epics/01-epic-launch-showcase-website.md)

## 🏗 Technical Approach

- **Static Site**: Zero backend dependencies
- **Hosting**: Free tier platforms (GitHub Pages/Netlify/Vercel)
- **Performance**: <3 second load times on standard broadband
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Browser Support**: Modern Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

## 🎥 Series Roadmap

- **Episode 1** [*(Current)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6R4v_tpIhE): Idea, Project Brief, PRD, draft Epic
- **Episode 2** *(Coming)*: Stories, tasks, and architecture alignment
- **Episode 3** *(Coming)*: Static site implementation and publishing
- **Episode 4** *(Coming)*: QA, analytics, polish, and release

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
